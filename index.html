<p>Hypestore (HYPErtext STORage Engine) is a storage engine and coordinator for Hypertext.  Hypestore provides a frictionless way for applications using HTTP as a wire protocol to persist entity state.  It does it's best not to be too picky about what you throw at it, just don't cross RFC 2616.  Together, we'll be <code>200 OK</code>.</p>

<a name="ambitions" class="anchor" href="#ambitions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ambitions</h3>
<p>
Unconditional RFC 2616 compliance.

<h3>
<a name="why" class="anchor" href="#why"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why?</h3>

<p>
At first glance, Hypestore appears to be no different than the multitude of web servers out there (aside from, perhaps, it's RFC 2616 compliance aspirations.)  However, while most web server packages offer support for GET's that map directly to a file system; once you want to start mutating you need to resort to an explicit application layer or WebDAV (or something).  Let's stop these methodist practices and start treating all verbs as equal.

<a name="synopsis" class="anchor" href="#synopsis"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Synopsis</h3>

<p>
For request URL: <code>http://hypestore.org/music/artist/prince/albums/1999/Little%20Red%20Corvette.wav</code>
<p>
<code>Content-Type: audio/vnd.wave</code><br>
<code>Content-Length: 70790540</code>
<br>
<code>POST /music/artist/prince/albums/1999/Little%20Red%20Corvette.wav</code>
</p>
<p>
Hypestore.org's Hypestore server receives the POST request, and saves the appropriate resource (as a plain-old file) to it's configured storage volume (directly attached or "backless"). This is helpful, since the file will be available for Hypestore to respond with when the next <code>GET /music/artist/prince/albums/1999/Little%20Red%20Corvette.wav</code> comes around.

<h3>
<a name="replication" class="anchor" href="#replication"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Replication</h3>
<p>
Hypestore replication clusters can be established ad-hoc.  Replication techniques are largely driven by the particular mutation velocity of the data being replicated.  Hypestore's base replication strategy forwards all DELETEs, POSTs and PUTs (mutators) to the Hypestore servers (identified by host and port) locally configured as replicas.  Hence, when a DELETE, PUT or POST (mutating operations) request is received and committed by a Hypestore server principal, it will initiate a user-agent behind the scenes to execute that request verbatim to each server in it's nuclear family.  The Hypestore replicator subsystem HTTP clients forwarding requests will identify themselves as a member of the replication family by way of the HTTP User-Agent header, the string of which will include a key for purposes of intra-family authentication.
